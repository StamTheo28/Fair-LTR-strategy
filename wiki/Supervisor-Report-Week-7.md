#### What was agreed from previous meeting?

* Main Task for this week was to start working on draft of a Retrieval Model with LTR to get more familiar with how PyTerrier work
* Create my own Retrieval model using randmom scores


#### What is your progress?

* Used the Vaswani dataset, since it is a small dataset and efficient in working with
* Was able to add a column of random scores on the retrieved rank data
* I was mostly trying to create my own wmodel, in order to create features with my own wmodel and use them to ltr

#### Are there any issues or challenges?

* Could not create a working wmodel
* So now i am trying produce scores and fit them directly to the ltr

#### Questions?

*

#### Expectations for following week?

* Finish working on my own model
