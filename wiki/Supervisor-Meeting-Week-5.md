# Meeting Summary

During the meeting we discussed what my next steps should be. These would be:
- Use my own function in PyTerrier to come up with my own features, which i can combine with other models ( BM25,...)
- Be able to:
-  1. Access retrival oriented scores
-  2. Access document statistics
-  3. Meta-data of documents
-  This will be done by using any dataset
-  Look into IR-datasets which contain Fair Ranking features
