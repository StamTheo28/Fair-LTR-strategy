#####  Query Autocompletion:
- allows you to add on-the-fly geographic query predictions to your application. Instead of searching for a specific location, a user can type in a categorical search, such as "pizza near New York" and the service responds with a list of suggested queries matching the string.

##### Qrels:  
- Are judgments made by humans as to whether a document is relevant to an information need (i.e., topic)  

##### TREC:
- The TREC dataset is dataset for question classification consisting of open-domain, fact-based questions divided into broad semantic categories. It has both a six-class (TREC-6) and a fifty-class (TREC-50) version. Both have 5,452 training examples and 500 test examples, but TREC-50 has finer-grained labels
