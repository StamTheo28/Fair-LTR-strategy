#### What was agreed from previous meeting?

* Main task for this week was to complete implementing my own function, and combine my features into a pipeline
* Look on how to manipulate datasets

#### What is your progress?

* Created my own feature scores through text size in each document and some random numbers
* combined these features into the list of features created by the relevance models (pl2, tfidf)

#### Are there any issues or challenges?

* BatchRetrieval returns the top 1000 ranked documents by defautl. However, in some cases it returned much less ranked documents meaning that some documents are irrelevant to some queries. This effect my merging of my features to the features list as computation of all QxD had to be calculated and muched

#### Questions?

* 

#### Expectations for following week?

* Procced with the research of the Bias Datasets
