### Summary

- Discused previous challenges of not being able to have a full pyTerrier tutorial due to pathing problems on Windows
- Thus, we came up with the solution of working the tutorials on juoyter and colab and then for the actual implementation use Virtual Machine
- Also, discussed and explained how ranking models work
- 2 fair ranking impelementations:
- 1) Take multiple ranking set and come up with multi-set metrics
- 2) Use counterfactual ranking with uses only 1 setm but randomizes docments during first ranking process
